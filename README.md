# Object Detection with Audio Alerts

> A real-time object detection system on NVIDIA Jetson that sends **spoken alerts** when specific objects (like humans, animals, or vehicles) are detected.

---

## ðŸ§  The Algorithm

This project uses the `jetson.inference` library with the **SSD-Mobilenet-v2** model to detect objects from a live camera feed on a Jetson device.

When an object (e.g., a human, cat, dog, or vehicle) is detected with a confidence score above a threshold, the system announces it using `espeak` (a text-to-speech engine).

### ðŸ’¡ How It Works:
1. **Camera Input**  
   CSI or USB camera feeds are captured using `jetson.utils.videoSource`.

2. **Object Detection**  
   The `jetson.inference.detectNet` model processes each frame using SSD-Mobilenet-v2.

3. **Cooldown Mechanism**  
   Repeated detections are throttled with a cooldown timer to avoid audio spamming.

4. **Audio Alerts**  
   When an object passes the confidence threshold, a corresponding phrase is spoken using `espeak`.

## ðŸ§  AI Model: SSD-Mobilenet-v2

SSD-Mobilenet-v2 is a lightweight and fast object detection model designed to run efficiently on edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson.

- **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)**  
  Divides the image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes + class labels for each cell, enabling fast real-time detection.

- **MobileNet (Backbone Network)**  
  Optimized for low-power and high-speed inference, making it ideal for embedded systems.

- **Dataset**: MSCOCO (Common Objects in Context)  
  - 330K+ labeled images  
  - 1.5M+ object instances  
  - 80 object classes, including:
    - ClassID 1: Human  
    - ClassID 2: Bicycle  
    - ClassID 3: Car  
    - ClassID 4: Motorcycle  
    - ...  
    - ClassID 80: Toaster
